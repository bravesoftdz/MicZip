# MicZip
A file compression program, made in PascalABC.NET by me, Michael Agarkov.

MicZip currently has just the most basic features a file archiver has, and lacks features (for now)

I am planning to make updates of MicZip and add much more into it, so just give me some time!

It's distributed under the BSD 4-Clause License, so you can make **your own version of it**, if you follow the EULA, of course.

It's size is also 1.5 MB, so it will be perfect to save space on your small laptop ;)

I hope you like it, and you will make use out of it!

For the source code, I recommend using PascalABC.NET version 3.4.2 build 2050, because it's the version I use, and the version it is compiled in. You can get it here: https://tinyurl.com/PascalABCNET
