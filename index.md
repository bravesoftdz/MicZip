## Download MicZip

### Compiler for the source code
I recommend using [PascalABC.NET version 3.4.2 build 2050](https://archive.org/download/pascalabc.net/PascalABCNETWithDotNetSetup.exe) because it's the version MicZip is compiled in.

## Supported file formats
- v1.0 - [7z](https://www.7-zip.org/7z.html)
- v1.2 - [rar](https://www.rarlab.com/rar_file.htm) (only unpack)

You can [add more file formats to MicZip](https://github.com/MichaelAgarkov/MicZip/wiki/Modifying) since it's open-source!
